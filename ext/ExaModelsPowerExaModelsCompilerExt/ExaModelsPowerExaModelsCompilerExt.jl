module ExaModelsPowerExaModelsCompilerExt

# ExaModelsPower's side of the `compile_all` contract. It lives in an extension
# so the package never depends on the compiler: `using ExaModelsCompiler`
# activates this, and nothing changes for anyone who only builds models.
#
# The shape this package needs, and why it differs from a size-parameterized
# provider: an OPF model is not instantiated at a SIZE, it is instantiated at a
# CASE. Every model here carries an argument function — `opf_args` for the
# static formulations, `mpopf_args_default` for multi-period — which the
# compiled library calls with a matpower path, so what crosses the C boundary
# is a string rather than an integer. `sizes` has nothing to mean here;
# `cases` does.

# The models this package can compile, each with the instantiation spec it
# needs. Multi-period bakes (N, curve, Nbus) into its recipe, so its entry is
# per-case in a way the static ones are not — the spec belongs to the model,
# not to the call.

    compile_all(ExaModelsPower; path = "@emp", case, T, N, only, exclude, kwargs...)

Compile this package's models into one shared library.

`case` is the matpower file the recipes are built against — its TYPES are what
the compiler needs, not its values, so the resulting library instantiates any
case at run time from a path. The multi-period models additionally bake `N` and the
load curve, which is why they are per-`N` in a way the static ones are not.

`path` defaults to the shared depot entry `"@emp"`.

```julia
compile_all(ExaModelsPower)                        # all six, into "@emp"
compile_all(ExaModelsPower; only = [:acp, :dcp])
