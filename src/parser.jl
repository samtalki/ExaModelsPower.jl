# specialize, so its result is an unparameterized NamedTuple and every field
# read off it widens to `AbstractArray{BusRow{T}} where T`. Written `::Type{T}`
# it is a static parameter and the whole chain stays concrete. The forward has
# to be positional for the same reason: PowerIO's `T` keyword is a value of an
# abstract `Type{<:Real}`, so a keyword forward drops the static parameter.
